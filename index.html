	  		<h2> We need <em>You</em>!</h2>
	  		<p> Eurasian otters have staged a remarkable comeback in the UK, where they’re now once again present in every single county. But habitat loss and hunting have brought many populations of other otter species crashing down around the world, especially in more tropical locations. North American sea otters are something of a recent success story after they were brought close to extinction in the 19th century, widely hunted for their fur. This was stopped by the establishment of the International Fur Seal Treaty in 1911. Populations in Canada and California are now doing well.

			As a charity we rely on memberships. They help us look after over 2,300 nature reserves and protect the animals that call them home. Please consider becoming a member of your local Otters Protection Institute today.Searching for an original gift for a nature lover? Sponsor an otter with the Otters Protection Institute to help fund conservation efforts. Around half of all our wildlife lives in the sea, but decades of over-exploitation have left our seas damaged and degraded; however, it's not too late to save them. Our vision is for Living Seas, where wildlife thrives and species driven to the brink become common once more. This is why we need you to help us. The planet need your help.

			<h3>Don't you dream of swimming with Otters? </h3>
	  		<h4>Did you know that many species of river-dwelling otter can swim quite quickly? – they have to be strong swimmers to catch fish and fight the flow of the river. With the giant otters of the Amazon growing up to 2m in length, you can imagine that they can swim pretty speedily when they want to!</h4>

			<h3> No way their cuteness will not make you swoon!</h3>
	  		<h4> Did you know Otters hug each other? A mother will often wrap the babies in kelp to keep them in one place while she hunts. Or, she might rely on human resources and otter ingenuity to find a makeshift "playpen" for her pup.</h4>

			<h3> Otters are a tight family, and you're part of it too!</h3>
  			<h4>A group of otters are called a bevy, family, lodge, or romp, or, when in water the group is called a raft. Unfortunately most species of Otters are Endangered or Threatened species.</h4>
